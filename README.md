## GenAI RAG Project

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using the `EleutherAI/gpt-neo-125M` model for generating responses. It combines document retrieval with FAISS and the GPT-Neo model for generation. No API key is required, as the model and libraries used are open-source. The project includes a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the system's setup and usage. Dependencies can be installed using `pip install transformers faiss-cpu sentence-transformers`.
